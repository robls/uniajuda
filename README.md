# Uni Ajuda

### UniAjuda project aims to provide a smoother experience to settle students that recently got into college or university in a new city, all in a mobile application.

### This web application serves as a panel to privileged users(admins), common users(customers) will have acess to the mobile app.

### Possible features that will be included

- List public transportation routes (buses, subways etc...)

- List deals offered by local commerce (markets, drug stores, papercraft shops anything )

- List republics looking to house new students or anyone willing to share a rent

- List any service offered by the city's hall

- List any cultural events happening in the near future

- Also list any real estate in the university's area

### To do's - FRONTEND

- [ ] User authentication with JWT
- [ ] Model proper entities schemas, the current one's are just proofs of concept, I need something that fit's the real world better
- [ ] Improve UX/UI, it will require some study though.
- Dynamic breadcrumbs with React, how ?
- [ ] Is it necessary to build a mobile version of this ?

### General features to do's list:

- [ ] model and implement backend to republics, local stores, colleges or universities.
      Here's the [backend repo](https://github.com/robls/uniajuda-backend)
- [ ] create frontend prototype models on adobexd to the web application that allows admins to manage which goes into the mobile app
- [ ] create mobile prototype models on adobexd
- [ ] implement frontend
- [ ] implement mobile

This is a personal project and with it I'm acquiring new knowledge every single day. I honestly think that, based on my college experience, this can be really helpful to it's public if delivered the right way.
